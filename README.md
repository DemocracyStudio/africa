# data africa
As a new cycle of research action and collaborations, I am working on five African cities: Cape Town, Lomé, Yaoundé, Nairobi, and Addis Ababa.  This repo contains the code of the data analysis produced in this context.

- Medium africa is a data analysis of medium.com platform content on Africa topic. It includes feature extraction with BERT machine learning, notably text classification and text summarisation, as well as a countries' names entity detection using the Bag-of-Words technique.
- Google map analysis of the supermarket reviews includes web scraping using selenium, an extraction of latitudes and longitudes from urls, and a visualisation of the ratings pinpointed on maps of the cities.
- Facebook marketplace analysis constitutes a scraping of the products sold in each city on the platform. Aside of the automation in the web navigation through facebook, this notebook contains an object detection from images using openCV, and an extraction of addresses from sellers' description using Named Entity Recognition.
